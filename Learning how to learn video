	Summary of what I learnt from the video- “Learning how to Learn.”
There are two modes of learning and Thinking;
a.	Focused mode: which is concentrating on things that are usually familiar.
b.	Diffused mode: a relaxed mode of thinking: “your thoughts are free to wander”.
Normally when we don’t desire doing/ learning something, go through it and come back to it and just start. The discomfort sometimes goes away and, in the long run, this will eventually lead to satisfaction.
When we learnt something new, we should make sure to take time to rest, then come to it and recall what has been learnt previously. This is very important. Don’t cram information in a single day, because it might lead to inefficient learning. It’s like building a house without laying solid foundation and the letting bricks dry.
Revisiting and practicing more of what we learn can be helpful and important to be able to remembered. Research show that speed repetition is the best way to build and strengthen synaptic connections. 
	Sleeping is also important because it help clears the metabolic toxins from the brain after a day of “brain use”. It is very essential to have a good rest by directly sleeping after learning something new. It was shown that exercising and/ or being in a rich social environment helps ours brain to produce new neurons. We shouldn’t be locked in the room. It is important that we stay very active and spare time for exercise, which includes general physical activities and friends daily.
