Chapter 6 and 7
User Space: It’s a sane environment for applications (Unlike the kernel)

The Main components are
•	Programs –examples: init and shell
•	Libraries example: libs
•	Configuration files in /etc
•	Device nodes in /dev
•	User data in /home

The root file system
•	Mounted by the kernel during boot
•	Requires a root .. kernel command line 
•	Ram disk (initramfs)
•	Storage device: flash, SD, hard disk
•	Networks: nfs

“Got a rootfs with the board”
•	As with the toolchain, this is usually a trap!
•	Board vendors over-configure to show off the board
•	Bloated root file system
•	Slow boot
•	Yet, they only offer a limited set of packages
•	And limited or no update service
Other options for a root file system

	Roll your-own (RTO)
	Use an integrated build tool
	Buildroot
	Open Embedded
	Ubuntu or Debian
Single binary that masquerades as many Linux utilities, including
	Init
	Ash  (a Bourne shell)
	File system utilities: mount, umount
	Network utilities: ifconfig, route
	And of course, the vi editor
Busybox example
Ls –l  /bin
So, whenever you type for example
Cat /etc/inittab
Launches /bin/busybox with argv [0] = “/bin/cat”

Busybox main() parses argv[0] and jumps to cat applet
Init



•	/sbin/init is the first program to be run
•	change by setting kernel parameter “init=…”
•	Two common version of init
•	Example by buildroot
Busybox init

Summary:
Starts when kernel mounts rootfs
First program to run is (
default) /sbin/init
Both busybox init and system V init are
